This is a terminal mockup I made.
Why did I make this?
I intend to create a game - Project PathOS.
A game based around hacking and typing actual terminal commands to interact with the world around oneself.
Surely I needed an actual terminal logic mockup for this.
And this is my creation - the Silver terminal mockup.
It was never intended to be an emulator. No sane person stores their terminal emulator's passwords in plaintext above
the root directory.
It was meant to be a terminal environment mockup.
Realistically, I intend for the player to only be able to access files up to the root directory.
Which is why I call it a mockup, not an emulator.
